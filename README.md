Question 2:
A normal distribution is a common probability distribution . It has a shape often referred to as a "bell curve."
Many everyday data sets typically follow a normal distribution: for example, the heights of adult humans, the scores on a test given to a large class, errors in measurements.
The normal distribution is always symmetrical about the mean.
The standard deviation is the measure of how spread out a normally distributed set of data is.  It is a statistic that tells you how closely all of the examples are gathered around the mean in a data set.  The shape of a normal distribution is determined by the mean and the standard deviation. The steeper the bell curve, the smaller the standard deviation.  If the examples are spread far apart, the bell curve will be much flatter, meaning the standard deviation is large. 

In general, about 68%68% of the area under a normal distribution curve lies within one standard deviation of the mean.
That is, if x¯x¯ is the mean and σσ is the standard deviation of the distribution, then 68%68% of the values fall in the range between (x¯−σ)(x¯−σ) and (x¯+σ)(x¯+σ) . In the figure below, this corresponds to the region shaded pink.
About 95% of the values lie within two standard deviations of the mean, that is, between (x¯−2σ) and (x¯+2σ) .
(In the figure, this is the sum of the pink and blue regions: 34%+34%+13.5%+13.5%=95% .)
About 99.7% of the values lie within three standard deviations of the mean, that is, between (x¯−3σ) and (x¯+3σ) 

Question3:
If our data contains outliers , then we would typically rather use the median 
because otherwise the value of the mean would be dominated by the outliers rather than the typical values. 
In conclusion, if we are considering the mean, we need to check our data for outliers.
